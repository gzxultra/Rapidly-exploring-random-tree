# Robotics-RRT

This project implements Rapidly-exploring random tree data structure and path planning algorithm.

## Get Started

Please follow the instructions here:

* install ROS kinect
* start your ros by `roscore`
* open another terminal tab and run `cd` ${Project folder}
* compile this project by `make`
* execute the program by `./robotics_rrt`
* open another terminal tab and run `rosrun rviz rviz`
* create a Maker in your RVIZ
* GO Hoosier!

## What I haven't cover?

* Configuration space
    - complicated, I will make it up if got more time

* Kinodynamics
* More types of Obstacles
    - they are similar, just need to inherit the base class and implement the collision detecting method
